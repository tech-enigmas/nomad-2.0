Functional Requirements
List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

An admin can create and delete user accounts
A user can update their profile information
A user can search all of the locations in the map
A user can search weather of a specific location


Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of 
the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

- Usability - user will be able to navigate throughout the app so they will understand how the sections are organized and how to use the functionality of the app to access the pages that will fulfill their needs. The site will be straightforward to understand and accessible to all users

- Modifiable - the system will be easy to modify if refactoring is required in the future. It will also be scalable to more can be added without having to refactor the layout of the app. The organization of components will be efficient enough so that future modifications will be streamlined.  


If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some
research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying 
“Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
